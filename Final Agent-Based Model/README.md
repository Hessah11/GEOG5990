## Final Agent-Based Model

This code is created as part of an assignment for GEOG5990 
at University of Leeds.

The code is an Agent-Based Model which creates agents based on data scrapped
from the web and an environment that is read from an input text file.
The created agents interact with the environment and with each other, and these
interactions can be seen as an animation on the GUI window.

To run the model the files required are:
* model.py (main file)
* agentframework.py (agents class)
* in.txt (input file)

The model is run using the model.py program.

Note: If using Spyder to run this code, ensure that the iPython Console 
graphics setting is set to inline by navigating to Tools > Preferences >
 iPython Console > Graphics (Restart Spyder if you make any changes)
This is required for the animation window to run as intended.
